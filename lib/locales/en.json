    "major": "A major chord built on {root}, containing a major third (4 semitones) and perfect fifth (7 semitones). Creates a bright, stable, and happy sound that forms the foundation of Western harmony.",
    "minor": "A minor chord built on {root}, containing a minor third (3 semitones) and perfect fifth (7 semitones). The flattened third gives it a darker, more melancholic character compared to major chords.",
    "dominant-7th": "A major triad with an added minor seventh (10 semitones from root). This creates harmonic tension that naturally wants to resolve, making it essential in blues, jazz, and classical harmony.",
    "major-7th": "A major triad with an added major seventh (11 semitones from root). Creates a dreamy, sophisticated sound popular in jazz and contemporary music. Less tense than dominant 7th chords.",
    "minor-7th": "A minor triad with an added minor seventh. Commonly used in jazz, R&B, and funk, it's less sad than a plain minor chord and adds harmonic richness without strong tension.",
    "suspended": "Replaces the third with either a second (sus2) or fourth (sus4), creating an open, unresolved sound that neither major nor minor. Often resolves back to the major or minor version.",
    "diminished": "Built entirely of minor thirds (3 semitones each), creating maximum harmonic tension. Often used as passing chords or to create dramatic, unstable moments in music.",
    "augmented": "Contains a major third and augmented fifth (8 semitones), creating a mysterious, floating quality. The augmented fifth creates harmonic ambiguity and is popular in impressionist music.",
    "eleventh": "An extended chord that includes the 11th degree (4th) in addition to the basic triad. Creates rich, complex harmonies popular in jazz and contemporary music.",
    "add": "A chord with an added note that extends the basic triad without creating a full seventh chord. Common additions include 9th, 11th, and 13th intervals.",
    "default": "A {quality} chord with unique harmonic properties that adds color and character to musical progressions."
